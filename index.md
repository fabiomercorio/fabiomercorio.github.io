I am Assistant Professor (Tenure Track - RTDb) in Computer Science at [University of Milan-Bicocca](https://www.unimib.it/), and research collaborator at [CRISP Research Centre](https://www.crisp-org.it/), Italy.

### Research Interests
My current research interests include:

- *Artificial Intelligence:* eXplainable AI, interpretable models, local and global interpretation, explanation through symbolic approaches
- * Data Science :* data quality and data cleaning, vector-space models, word-embeddings, graph-base algorithms, ontology learning 
- *AI Planning past:* domain-independent planning, temporal continuous planning, planning in mixed discrete-continuous domains, planning in hybrid domain

### (Co)-Developed Tools
- *UPMurphi* is a tool for  linear and nonlinear continuous PDDL+ models with processes and events. It also handles huge state spaces through a disk-based algorithm
- *GraphDBLP* is a tool that models DBLP as a graph database for performing graph-based queries and social network analyses.

I’m also interested in putting my research into practice, take a look to Research Projects section for further details.
