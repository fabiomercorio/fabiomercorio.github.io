## About
I am Assistant Professor (Tenure Track - RTDb) in Computer Science at [University of Milan-Bicocca](https://www.unimib.it/), and member of the [CRISP Research Centre](https://www.crisp-org.it/), Italy.

#### My research interests include
- *Artificial Intelligence:* eXplainable AI, interpretable models, local and global interpretation, explanation through symbolic approaches
- *Data Science:* data quality and data cleaning, vector-space models, word-embeddings, graph-base algorithms, ontology learning, Graph-database algorithms 
- *AI Planning [past]:* domain-independent planning, temporal continuous planning, planning in mixed discrete-continuous domains, planning in hybrid domain

#### (Co)-Developed Tools
- [*UPMurphi*](https://github.com/fabiomercorio/UPMurphi) is a tool for  linear and nonlinear continuous PDDL+ models with processes and events. It also handles huge state spaces through a disk-based algorithm
-[*DiNo*](https://github.com/KCL-Planning/DiNo) A Planning tool built on top of UPMurphi that employs graph-based heuristics to speed up the plan synthesis (in collaboration with > Planning Group at King's College London)
- [*GraphDBLP*](https://github.com/fabiomercorio/GraphDBLP) is a tool that models DBLP as a graph database for performing graph-based queries and social network analyses

#### Granted Ongoing Research Projects
I have been working in the following granted reserch projects, that allows me putting my research on AI and XAI into practice:
- [2020-2021] A Data Driven Bridge Towards ESCO using AI Algorithms. Granted by [EURES](https://ec.europa.eu/eures/public/it/homepage) (call EaSI-EURES VP/2019/010).
