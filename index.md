#### (Co)-Developed Tools for Researchers
- [*MERLIN*](https://github.com/Crisp-Unimib/MERLIN) is a global, model-agnostic, contrastive explainer for any tabular or text classifier. It provides contrastive explanations of how the behaviour of two machine learning models differs. It is available as a python tool on Github. Related papers: [*[Decision Support Systems 2023]*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016792362300115X)
- [*ContrXT*](http://contrxt.ai) is a model agnostic, global, time contrastive explainer for any text classifier. It is available as a python tool on Github. Related papers: [*[Information-Fusion-22]*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253521002426?dgcid=author)
- [*TaxoRef*](https://github.com/Crisp-Unimib/TaxoRef) is a methodology for Taxonomy Refinement via word embeddings. It allows evaluating the best embedding on the basis of their ability to represent taxonomic similarity relations. Related papers: [*[ECML-PKDD-21]*](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-86523-8_37)
- [*GraphDBLP*](https://github.com/fabiomercorio/GraphDBLP) is a tool that models (and enriches) DBLP as a graph database for performing graph-based queries and social network analyses. Related papers: [*[ECML-PKDD-19]*](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-46133-1_46), [*[MTAP-18]*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11042-017-5503-2)
- [*UPMurphi*](https://github.com/fabiomercorio/UPMurphi) is a tool for  planning with linear and nonlinear continuous PDDL+ models with processes and events. It also handles huge state spaces through a disk-based algorithm. Related papers: [*[ICAPS-09]*](https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICAPS/ICAPS09/paper/view/707/1100), [*[Applied Intelligence 2012]*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10489-011-0306-z)
