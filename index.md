## About
I am Assistant Professor (Tenure Track - RTDb) in Computer Science at [University of Milan-Bicocca](https://www.unimib.it/), and a member of the [CRISP Research Centre](https://www.crisp-org.it/), Italy.

#### Current Positions
- [2016-present] **Assistant Professor**  at University of Milan-Bicocca
+ [2010-present] **Member** of CRISP Research Centre, Milan, Italy

####  Past Positions
- [2011-2016] **PostDoc** at University of Milan-Bicocca
- [2017-2018] **Partner** at TabulaeX Ltd (formerly spin-off company of Unimib) working on BI and Big Data Analytics. TabulaeX is now part of the Burning Glass Group
- [2015-2016] **Visiting Researcher** at King's College London, AI Planning Group, UK


#### My research interests include
- *Artificial Intelligence:* eXplainable AI, interpretable models, local and global interpretation, explanation through symbolic approaches
- *Data Science:* data quality and data cleaning, vector-space models, word-embeddings, ontology learning, Graph-database algorithms 
- *AI Planning [formerly]:* domain-independent planning, temporal continuous planning, planning in mixed discrete-continuous domains, planning in hybrid domain

#### (Co)-Developed Tools
- [*UPMurphi*](https://github.com/fabiomercorio/UPMurphi) is a tool for  planning with linear and nonlinear continuous PDDL+ models with processes and events. It also handles huge state spaces through a disk-based algorithm
- [*DiNo*](https://github.com/KCL-Planning/DiNo) A Planner built on top of UPMurphi that employs graph-based heuristics to speed-up the plan synthesis (leaded by "Planning Group" at King's College London)
- [*GraphDBLP*](https://github.com/fabiomercorio/GraphDBLP) is a tool that models (and enriches) DBLP as a graph database for performing graph-based queries and social network analyses

#### Granted Ongoing Research Projects
