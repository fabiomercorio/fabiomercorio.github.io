### My current research interests include
- *Artificial Intelligence:* eXplainable AI, interpretable models, local and global interpretation, explanation through symbolic approaches
- *Data Science:* data quality and data cleaning, vector-space models, word-embeddings, graph-base algorithms, ontology learning 
- *AI Planning [past]:* domain-independent planning, temporal continuous planning, planning in mixed discrete-continuous domains, planning in hybrid domain

### (Co)-Developed Tools
- [*UPMurphi*](https://github.com/fabiomercorio/UPMurphi) is a tool for  linear and nonlinear continuous PDDL+ models with processes and events. It also handles huge state spaces through a disk-based algorithm
- [*GraphDBLP*](https://github.com/fabiomercorio/GraphDBLP) is a tool that models DBLP as a graph database for performing graph-based queries and social network analyses.

I’m also interested in putting my research into practice, take a look to Research Projects section for further details.
