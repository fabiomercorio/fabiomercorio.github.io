## Ongoing Granted Research Projects
I have been working on the following granted reserch projects, that allow me putting my research on AI and XAI into practice:
- #### ``H2020``[PILLARS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101004703). 
Happy to lead the Unimib research unit of a new H-2020 project: Disvovering new occupations/skills and effect of robotisation within jobs through AI. More details soon, stay tuned! 
- #### ``EUROSTAT+CEDEFOP`` 
"Towards the European Web Intelligence Hub — European System for Collection and Analysis of Online Job Advertisement Data (WIH-OJA)". [link](https://etendering.ted.europa.eu/cft/cft-display.html?cftId=6559) Granted by Eurostat+Cedefop for building the European Web Intelligence Hub, putting AI into Labour Market for whole 27+1 EU Country (2021-2024) More details soon, stay tuned! 
- #### ``Observatory of Digital Competences`` [2017-2021].  
The [Observatory of Digital Competences](http://competenzedigitali.org/), granted by  the Italian Unions of ICT  (Assinform, Assintel, Assinter) with support of AgiD (Agenzia Italia Digitale) and MIUR. 
- #### ``AI and Legal Study Perspectives``  [2020-2023].    
Evaluating the impact of AI on Legal labour markets. PRIN-2017 project granted by MIUR

## Past Granted Research Projects
- #### ``Real-Time LMI`` [2016-2020].   
Real-time Labour Market information on Skill Requirements: Setting up the EU system for online vacancy analysis granted by [Cedefop EU Agency](https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/it/about-cedefop/public-procurement/real-time-labour-market-information-skill-requirements-setting-eu)
- #### ``AI4ESCO`` [2020-2020].  
A Data Driven Bridge Towards ESCO using AI Algorithms. Granted by [EURES](https://ec.europa.eu/eures/public/it/homepage) (call EaSI-EURES VP/2019/010).     
- #### ``ETF`` [2019-2020].  
”Digital  innovation:   Big  Data  and  Labour  Market  Information  -  SP  EMPL”  -  granted by ETF ([The European  Training  Foundation](https://www.etf.europa.eu/)).   
- #### ``SLEM Smart Legal Management`` [2018-2020].  
SLEM Smart Legal Management granted by MIUR as PON project to process unstructured documents to to reduce legal risk through AI.
- #### ``Prototype on Real-Time LMI`` [2014-2016].    
Real-time Labour Market information on skill requirements: feasibility study and
working prototype. Granted by [Cedefop EU Agency](https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/it/about-cedefop/public-procurement/real-time-labour-market-information-skill-requirements-setting-eu)
- #### ``Data Consistency Evaluation through AI Planning`` [2012-2014].  
Granted by Arifl Agency on behalf of Lombardy Region. The project goal was to define an algorithm for checking the data quality (consistency) of weakly-structured data, here composed of tens million records from Administrative DBs exploiting the planning-as-model-checking paradigm.
- #### ``Automatic Data Cleansing through AI Planning`` [2012-2014].  
Granted by Arifl Agency on behalf of Lombardy Region. The project goal was to define an algorithm for automatically cleansing weakly-structured data. The project, as a challenge, has required to define and implement a novel technique (on top of UPMurphi) for the synthesis of the Universal Cleanser (a repository of all the feasible actions able to cleanse a dirty data.) The system is directly connected to an external database for retrieving and cleaning up to million records.
