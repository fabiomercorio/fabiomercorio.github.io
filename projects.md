## Ongoing Granted Research Projects
I have been working on the following granted reserch projects, that allow me putting my research on AI and XAI into practice:
- #### ``AI4ESCO`` [2020-2021] 
A Data Driven Bridge Towards ESCO using AI Algorithms. Granted by [EURES](https://ec.europa.eu/eures/public/it/homepage) (call EaSI-EURES VP/2019/010).
- #### Real-Time LMI [2016-2020]
Real-time Labour Market information on Skill Requirements: Setting up the EU system for online vacancy analysis granted by [Cedefop EU Agency](https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/it/about-cedefop/public-procurement/real-time-labour-market-information-skill-requirements-setting-eu)
- #### SLEM Smart Legal Management [2018-2020] 
SLEM Smart Legal Management granted by MIUR as PON project to process unstructured documents to to reduce legal risk through AI.
- #### Observatory of Digital Competences [2017-2020]
The [Observatory of Digital Competences](http://competenzedigitali.org/), granted by  the Italian Unions of ICT  (Assinform, Assintel, Assinter) with support of AgiD (Agenzia Italia Digitale) and MIUR. 
- #### ETF#1 [2019-2020]
”Digital  innovation:   Big  Data  and  Labour  Market  Information  -  SP  EMPL”  -  granted by ETF ([The European  Training  Foundation](https://www.etf.europa.eu/)). 

## Past Granted Research Projects
- #### Data Consistency Evaluation through AI Planning [2012-2014]
Granted by Arifl Agency on behalf of Lombardy Region. The project goal was to define an algorithm for checking the data quality (consistency) of weakly-structured data, here composed of tens million records from Administrative DBs exploiting the planning-as-model-checking paradigm.
- #### Automatic Data Cleansing through AI Planning [2012-2014]
Granted by Arifl Agency on behalf of Lombardy Region. The project goal was to define an algorithm for automatically cleansing weakly-structured data. The project, as a challenge, has required to define and implement a novel technique (on top of UPMurphi) for the synthesis of the Universal Cleanser (a repository of all the feasible actions able to cleanse a dirty data.) The system is directly connected to an external database for retrieving and cleaning up to million records.
