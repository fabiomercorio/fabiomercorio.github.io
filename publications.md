title={GraphLMI: A data driven system for exploring labor market information through graph databases},
journal={Multimedia Tools and Applications},
year={2020},
month={Jun},
day={29},
abstract={Labor Market Intelligence (LMI) is an emerging field of study that has been gaining interest as it allows employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms on labor market information. The goal of LMI is to support decision and policy making activities (e.g., real-time monitoring of Online Job Vacancies (OJV) across countries, forecast skill requested within vacancies, compare similar labor markets across borders, etc.). The European project in which this work is framed can be placed in this field, as it aims at collecting and classifying millions of OJVs from 28 EU Countries, handling 32 languages, and also extracting the requested skills. The result is a huge amount of information useful for understanding labor market dynamics and trends. The goal of this work is to realize a system - namely GraphLMI - that organizes such Labor Market information as a graph, enabling the representation of occupation/skill relevance and similarity over the European Labor Market; another goal is to enrich the European standard taxonomy of occupations and skills (ESCO) to better fit the labor market expectations. We formalize and design the GraphLMI data model, then we implement it as a graph-database, generated by processing 5.3+ million OJVs composed by free text and collected between 2018 and 2019 for France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Finally, we show how the resulting knowledge can be queried through a declarative query language to understand, compare and evaluate country-based labor market dynamics for supporting policy and decision making activities at European level.},

abstract = "This paper develops a set of innovative tools for labor market intelligence by applying machine learning techniques to web vacancies on the Italian labor market. Our approach allows to calculate, for each occupation, the different types of skills required by the market alongside a set of relevant variables such as region, sector, education and level of experience. We construct a taxonomy for skills and map it into the recently developed ESCO classification system. We subsequently develop measures of the relevance of soft and hard skills and we analyze their detailed composition. We apply the dataset constructed to the debate on computerization of work. We show that soft and digital skills are related to the probability of automation of a given occupation and we shed some light on the complementarity/substitutability of hard and soft skills."

pages="477--502",
abstract="In the last decades, an increasing number of employers and job seekers have been relying on Web resources to get in touch and to find a job. If appropriately retrieved and analyzed, the huge number of job vacancies available today on on-line job portals can provide detailed and valuable information about the Web Labor Market dynamics and trends. In particular, this information can be useful to all actors, public and private, who play a role in the European Labor Market. This paper presents WoLMIS, a system aimed at collecting and automatically classifying multilingual Web job vacancies with respect to a standard taxonomy of occupations. The proposed system has been developed for the Cedefop European agency, which supports the development of European Vocational Education and Training (VET) policies and contributes to their implementation. In particular, WoLMIS allows analysts and Labor Market specialists to make sense of Labor Market dynamics and trends of several countries in Europe, by overcoming linguistic boundaries across national borders. A detailed experimental evaluation analysis is also provided for a set of about 2 million job vacancies, collected from a set of UK and Irish Web job sites from June to September 2015.",
